# ComicTracker
Web application that allows users to track their comic book reading progress, in the same vein as sites like [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/), [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) and others.
Based on *ASP.NET Core*.

## Documentation

Information on the app's different aspects can be found in the [ComicTracker wiki](https://github.com/MTheSestrim/ComicTracker/wiki).
